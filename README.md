## FINAL YEAR PROJECT 2023 (RE-CREATION)

This project is the **reconstruction** of my final year project for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. When we're creating the project for the final year project work assesment I didn't thought of Transfer Learning technique for the Model Building process. I continued with the experimentation and found that Transfer Learning woruld be a great choise and help us to build a more accurate solution according to our problem statement.

### MOTIVATION AND GOAL

The primary aim of this project is to incorporate the **recommendations** provided by the esteemed Examiner after the presentation of the original project.

### RUN LOCALLY

- Download the pre-trained model from [here](https://github.com/dipakexe/lung-disease-detection-models) and save it to `models/` directory. (Optional) You can also train the model of your own if you want.
- Run the `app.py` flask app.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

- Make sure python (>3.10) and flask is installed properly.
- Make sure the latest version of tensorflow and keras is installed.
